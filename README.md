# Diversity-Inclusion-Dashboard
🚀 **Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard – PwC Power BI Job Simulation Task-3!** 🚀

Focused on building a **Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard** for a telecom client, in collaboration with PwC Switzerland! 
📊 The goal is to help the client achieve a stronger **executive gender balance** through data-driven insights on **hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover** metrics. 📈

💡 **Project Overview:** 
This dashboard tracks KPIs that highlight gender balance, allowing the management to **clearly visualize** data and pinpoint areas for improvement. 
Each data point tells a story about **Diversity and Inclusion** in the company’s workforce.

🔍 **Key Insights:**
*Hiring:* While female hires are higher at the **Junior Officer** level, there’s a significant drop in female representation at more senior positions. 📉

*Promotions:* Although promotion rates are generally higher for females in mid-level positions, this trend doesn’t extend into executive levels. 📊

*Turnover:* This rate varies across job levels and gender, with some positions showing **higher turnover for females**. Insights like this guide targeted retention efforts. 🚪

*Performance Rating:* Shows us the performance rating of Females & Males in all levels.
